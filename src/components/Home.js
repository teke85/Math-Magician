      A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
      Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and
      division mathematical calculations. However, more sophisticated
      calculators can handle exponential operations, square roots, logarithms,
      trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some
      calculators perform all these functions by repeated addition processes.
      This means that you can use these calculators to perform arithmetic
      operations on numbers.
